### How MDL Talent Hub is implementing AI

Artificial Intelligence, with a modern platform, comes modern technology.

In order to make our user experience as smart, intuitive and crisp as possible, we have set our sights on a couple of AI solutions that we are going to implement in order to better serve the needs of our users.

Here is a look of the first plans for AI implementation in the MDL Talent Hub platform.

4 Problems, 4 AI Solutions.

## Problem #1

Currently, the existing search functions don't allow talent bookers to quickly and easily find the talents they need. The time wasted with manual labor when searching for new talents, is a serious issue that needs to be resolved.

## AI Solution #1

We can give realtime recommendations based on the talents you are looking for; our recommendation engine will be able to recommend you the best talents. On top of that, our advance web crawling engine, scans the web for talents, inside Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, blogs, websites and updates you with the findings based on what you are looking for. We will be able to provide you with daily reports that are relevant so you can contact them directly even outside our platform.

## Problem #2

Talent bookers have all experienced it before: You book a talent for a certain event, and suddenly, last minute, they cancel. This is horrible for both the Talent Booker and their client as they both have a lot to lose because of this.

## AI Solution #2

By going through the meta-data on the MDL Talent Hub platform and analysing the cancelation patterns of talents and going through profiles of similar talents, the MDL Talent Hub platform will be able to suggest alternative talents to fill in for missing talents.

Bookers will also be able to see a cancelation rating that will help them reduce the risk of cancelation by working with talents who score low on the cancelation rating.

## Problem #3

The lack of industry insights. All over the world, bookers and talents are working in an environment that is shrouded by secrets, competition and an industry that is hard to monitor. This makes the evolution in ones career more of a guessing game with high risks.

## AI Solution #3

Bringing together big data analysis for industry insight use and balancing that out with what can, and can not be shared, collected or studies to ensure that everyone has their expected level of privacy while allowing them the professional courtesy of conducting business the way they always have is a tough challenge to solve but with the help of AI, we can make sure that everything is done following a set of rules, safety conducts and out of the hands of human error. This helps ensure that when we analyse messages, comments, profiles and other information to identify patterns, moods and behaviors, that we don't breach any privacy concerns.

This big data will allow us to also identify haters, troublemakers, what companies, products, services or talents are most loved or hated, etc. and help create a safer and better environment for both talents and bookers that we can always update based on the new information and patterns collected.

## Problem #4

Spam. It's a problem across all industries, but not only spam, also fake messages, reviews, etc.

## AI solution #4

Artificial Intelligence will learn to identify and prevent spam by learning constantly what kind of patterns, behaviors or keywords are used for spamming messages around the network. This will remove such users and behaviors by applying a strict ethical policy with swift and direct ways of resolving such behaviors to prevent future repetition.

These are the first 4 applications that our development team will be focussing, in order to implement the power of artificial intelligence into the MDL Talent Hub platform. More will come in due time, but we are focussing on the most achievable and pressing problems that we can solve first.
